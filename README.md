# motogymkhana time registration server UI #

This is a web UI for the Motogymkhana time registration server. It uses the server api, it doesn't have persistence or a database by itself. It uses a servlet container to run (as a .war file).

The app uses Tapestry for its UI, HttpClient for communicating with a server that is run locally or remote, via ssl.
